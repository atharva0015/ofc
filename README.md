# Self-Healing Test Framework

Fail-closed self-healing for UI and API test failures, built as a reference
MVP in Python 3.12. The deterministic core classifies, scores, gates, and
performs Git operations; models only propose candidates. Unknown,
low-confidence, conflicting, or contract-changing results fail the test and
escalate to a human.

The current evidence set is in [`docs/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`](docs/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md).
It labels every number **MEASURED**, **SIMULATED**, or **UNVERIFIED** and
links the command and artifact behind it. The open-work backlog is
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md), split into P0/P1/P2.

[`docs/PROJECT_EXPLAINED.md`](docs/PROJECT_EXPLAINED.md), a plain-English
guide to how it works, what is real, and what the end user experiences.

## Quickstart

Requires Python 3.12. No Docker, browser, or network is needed for the
tests or the one-command demo.

Windows:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv312
.venv312\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv312\Scripts\python tasks.py test
.venv312\Scripts\python tasks.py demo
.venv312\Scripts\python tasks.py dashboard
```

Unix:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv312
.venv312/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv312/bin/python tasks.py test
.venv312/bin/python tasks.py demo
.venv312/bin/python tasks.py dashboard
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> for the read-only dashboard. `tasks.py gates`
is optional in the quickstart: it currently exits 0 with **11 PASS / 0 FAIL
/ 1 UNVERIFIED**. `tasks.py gates-strict` exits 1 until the survival gate
has history or a written waiver, so release checks cannot ignore missing
evidence.

If `make` is installed, the same targets are available as `make test` and
`make demo`. `tasks.py` is the Windows-friendly equivalent of every Makefile
target and always runs through the active interpreter.

## What the demo shows

`tasks.py demo` runs 24 pre-registered drift scenarios through the full
in-process pipeline and prints the pipeline choice, the Healenium simulator
alone, and the layered Critic verdict. It ends with two complete structured
explanation records: one heal and one escalation.

Everything in the demo is **SIMULATED** (in-process HTML plus the simulator).
It is designed to show the decision path, not to claim live-browser results.
The demo takes seconds.

## Codebase Healing & Optimality Studio

`python tasks.py studio` serves the interactive modern Web Studio at <http://127.0.0.1:8081>.
It enables developers and QA engineers to:
- **3-Page Interactive Wizard**:
  - **Stage 1 (Upload & Ingest)**: Upload any arbitrary codebase `.zip` archive or load built-in sample presets; triggers an animated 5.2-second high-tech radar scanner modal with live diagnostics before transitioning.
  - **Stage 2 (Detect & Remediate)**: Autonomous detection and classification of bugs, code smells, and algorithmic bottlenecks ($O(N^2) \rightarrow O(1)$ hash sets, recursion memoization). Allows one-click defect auto-healing and performance optimization.
  - **Stage 3 (XAI Audit & Diff)**: Full Explainable AI (XAI) breakdown per patch (Root Cause Analysis, Remediation Logic, Safety Invariants), interactive syntax-highlighted unified diffs, and instant `.zip` export of the healed project.
- **Theme Support**: Seamless Dark and Light theme toggle with `localStorage` persistence.
- **Autonomous Bug Healing**: Scans for syntax errors, runtime crashes, mutable default parameters, unclosed file descriptors, and failing tests. Synthesizes optimal patches using local free LLMs (via Ollama / LocalAI) or deterministic AST synthesis with sandbox verification.
- **Code Optimality Engine**: Refactors linear searches in loops to $O(1)$ set lookups, replaces unmemoized exponential recursion with dynamic programming caches, and converts string concatenation in loops into buffer joins.

## Standalone Demo Storefront

`python tasks.py demo-ui` serves the NovaMart E-Commerce Storefront on <http://127.0.0.1:8082>. It acts as an independent realistic web application featuring simulated taxation errors, lookup bottlenecks, and resource leaks for live testing—completely decoupled from the main healing engine.

## Read-only dashboard

`python tasks.py dashboard` serves a local page showing the quality gates,
the newest 25 explanation records, and the latest saved metrics snapshot.
It is GET-only, masks PII, escapes displayed text, and never heals or
writes. It has no authentication, so bind it to localhost only. See
`docs/DASHBOARD.md` for routes, data sources, and limits.

## How it works

```text
failing test
  -> adapters        normalize runner output (UI signals / API failure)
  -> classifier      deterministic class + probabilities
  -> matching        Healenium candidates, transparent rescorer
  -> sandbox         in-process replay of up to three attempts
  -> critic          deterministic, state, network, intent checks
  -> policy          confidence, ambiguity margin, blocked classes, budgets
  -> xai             structured explanation record first, narrative second
  -> alerts/gitops   escalation or shadow/reviewed PR
```

Safety invariants:

- Genuine regressions, environment faults, contract changes, removed or
  weakened assertions, and performance thresholds never reach the heal engine.
- A sandbox pass alone never approves a heal; the layered Critic must also
  pass, and an optional LLM cannot override a failed deterministic check.
- Every heal stores model, prompt, policy, and config versions for replay.
- Secrets come from environment variables; PII is masked before any external
  call.
- Unknown or malformed input escalates; it never guesses.

## Current limits (say these out loud)

- The **raw live Healenium matcher** still heals all 9 adversarial cases.
  That is a **non-gating diagnostic**: the gate measures the shipped
  orchestrator path, which escalates all 9 (`adversarial_fhr = 0.0`).
- **Browser latency** is 1122 ms per heal. That is also a diagnostic; the
  gate measures orchestrator overhead (`pipeline_latency_ms`, ~20 ms).
- `heal_accuracy [live]` **PASSES** at 1.0 only because
  `scripts/bench_golden_live.py` derives `benchmark/reports/golden_live.json`
  from the historical 2026-10-08 live E2E report. It does not re-run the
  stack; treat it as measured-but-stale until Docker is available.
- Held-out API is **10/11**; `heldout:token-cart` misses because `observe()`
  lacks a `GET /api/cart` dispatch. Root cause and proposed fix:
  [`docs/TOKEN_CART_ANALYSIS.md`](docs/TOKEN_CART_ANALYSIS.md).
- `healing/adapters/` is a documented placeholder; there is no real runner
  ingestion yet.
- Real GitHub App PRs, Slack/Teams/Jira delivery, screenshot capture, and
  Prometheus/Grafana deployment have **not** been observed.
- Live benches need Docker; when it is unavailable they are historical and
  must be labelled that way.
- The project license is **TBD**; the package is not distributable until a
  human chooses one.
